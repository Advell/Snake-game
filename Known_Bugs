1. When the snake reaches around the upper left corner, the game over is triggered even though the game is still in the scope of the board

2. If the snake is going in one direction ie. "right", pressing down and left or up and left rapidly causes the snake to collapse on itself and eat itself

3. When the game over event is triggered, then when the game is restarted, the 3 fields that the snake was occupying (head and two first pieces of the 
body) will still count as the snake's body and will trigger the game over event if the new snake crosses them
