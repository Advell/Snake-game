1. When the snake reaches around the upper left corner, the game over is triggered even though the game is still in the scope of the board

2. If the snake is going in one direction ie. "right", pressing down and left or up and left rapidly causes the snake to collapse on itself and eat itself

3. If the game over evet is triggered when the snake is at the centre, and then restarting the game, it will cause the next snake to eat the previous snake
and thus trigger the game over again.
